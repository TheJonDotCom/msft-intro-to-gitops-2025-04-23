### LAB02: Creating and Managing Docker Images
Build and manage Docker images for a Node.js web application. This lab includes:
- Setting up the application directory and creating a Dockerfile.
- Building and verifying the Docker image locally.
- Running the Docker container locally and testing endpoints.
- Pushing the Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry for sharing and deployment.

### LAB03: Deploying Infrastructure with Terraform
Deploy and manage infrastructure using Terraform. This lab covers:
- Setting up Terraform configuration files (e.g., `provider.tf`, `main.tf`, `variables.tf`).
- Initializing, planning, and applying Terraform configurations.
- Deploying Azure resources such as virtual networks, load balancers, and virtual machines.
- Managing state files and outputs for infrastructure resources.

### LAB04: Automating Deployments with Ansible
Use Ansible to automate the deployment of a Web API application. This lab includes:
- Setting up an Ansible environment and inventory file.
- Creating a custom Ansible role to install Docker, pull a container image, and run the application.
- Verifying idempotency and testing the deployed application.
- Using ad-hoc Ansible commands to interact with remote hosts.
